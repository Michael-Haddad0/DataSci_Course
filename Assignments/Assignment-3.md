### Assignment 3

#### Introduction

This assignment is based on the example **The spam filter**. The objective is to try some variations of the filters developed in class.

#### Tasks

1. Develop a spam filter based on a **logistic regression equation** and evaluate it using a **confusion matrix**.

2. Drop the three `cap_` variables and **binarize** all the `word_` variables, transforming them into dummies for the occurrence of the corresponding word. Develop two spam filters, one based on a logistic regression equation and the other based on a **decision tree**, using the binarized data set.

3. Compare the three models obtained here with the models discussed in class.

#### Submission

Submit either a `.py` document with your code and short comments, or a full report in a Jupyter notebook, integrating the code, the Python output and your comments.

#### Deadline

Febrruary 20 (Wednesday), 24:00.
