### Assignment 2

#### Introduction

This assignment is focused on **churn modeling**. It uses the Omicron data set. Assume that the Omicron management plans to offer a 20% **discount** to the customers that the model classifies as potential churners, and that this offer is going to have a 100% success, so the company will retain all the churners detected.

#### Tasks

1. Assuming that all the customers pay the same, say $100, evaluate the **benefit**, that is, the extra revenues produced by the retention policy explained above, for the two models already developed in class.

2. Create a **Python function** that gives the benefit in terms of the cutoff.

3. Find an **optimal cutoff** for the retention policy proposed.

#### Submission

Submit either a `.py` document with your code and short comments, or a full report in a Jupyter notebook, integrating the code, the Python output and your comments.

#### Deadline

February 13 (Wednesday), 24:00.
